Unblock::HTTP1 is a non-blocking HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 protocol engine for Perl.

It parses requests, serializes responses, handles HTTP message boundaries,
streaming bodies, keep-alive, trailers, Upgrade, and CONNECT.

It does not open sockets, do DNS or TLS, run an event loop, or manage
connection pools. It can be hosted by IO::Async, AnyEvent, Linux::Event,
Mojolicious, native transport code, or another event framework.

## Installation

    cpanm Unblock::HTTP1

The 0.10 release requires Perl 5.16 and Uniform::HTTP 0.06 or newer.
The new API work on this feature branch has not yet been released.

## Start here

The three application classes are:

- Unblock::HTTP1::Client - one client-side connection
- Unblock::HTTP1::Server - one server-side connection
- Unblock::HTTP1::Transaction - one request and response exchange

A transaction uses the shared Unblock vocabulary: respond(), write(),
end(), send_informational(), state(), error(), is_complete(),
is_cancelled(), is_error(), and is_terminal().

The easiest server response:

    $tx->respond(
        status => 200,
        body   => "Hello World!\n",
    );

The easiest client request:

    $client->request(
        method    => 'GET',
        target    => '/',
        authority => 'example.test',
        on_response => sub {
            my ($tx, $response) = @_;
            print $response->status, "\n";
        },
    );

These calls still create and use canonical Uniform::HTTP::Request and
Uniform::HTTP::Response messages internally. Existing Uniform objects
continue to work directly:

    $client->request($request);
    $tx->respond($response);

## Connect to an event framework

Create one Client or Server per framework connection:

    $self->{http1} = Unblock::HTTP1::Server->new(
        transport  => $self,
        on_request => $on_request,
    );

The framework object implements only three host methods:

    unblock_send($bytes)      # accept complete output into framework queue
    unblock_finish()          # graceful close after queued output
    unblock_abort($reason)    # immediate failure close

The framework feeds incoming events to the engine:

    $http->input($bytes);
    $http->input_eof;
    $http->transport_error($reason);

The engine delivers output automatically. A delayed response from a timer
or database callback also triggers output without another framework read
event.

An integration that exposes congestion returns false from unblock_send()
AFTER accepting the whole buffer, and later calls $http->resume_output.
If the framework simply queues all output, it may return undef.

The engine holds a weak reference to the host. The framework owns its
sockets, output queue, and loop.

**Full working server and client examples:**

- examples/io-async-server.pl
- examples/io-async-client.pl
- examples/anyevent-server.pl
- examples/anyevent-client.pl

The examples separate adapter code from application code.

## Connection and message behavior

A Client queues requests serially on one connection; it does not silently
enable HTTP/1 pipelining. A Server can receive pipelined request bytes and
process them in HTTP order.

A server's on_request runs after the request head has arrived.
on_body delivers decoded request body fragments. on_request_end runs when the
full request, including trailers, is complete.

For a streaming response:

    $tx->respond(status => 200, stream_body => 1);
    $tx->write($chunk);
    $tx->end($final_bytes);

write() and end() accept bytes even when they return false for backpressure.
Use on_drain to resume producing data.

A clean read EOF is not the same as fatal transport failure. After a
fully received request, the server can still send a delayed response, then
close gracefully.

A 101 Upgrade response or successful CONNECT switches away from HTTP.
take_remainder() returns already-received bytes belonging to the next
protocol. An attached server invokes on_switch after the full outgoing
HTTP handshake has been accepted into the framework's write queue.

## Manual and native integration

For advanced consumers, the original low-level output interface remains:

    $http->input($bytes);
    while ($http->want_write) {
        $transport->write($http->output);
    }

This is for engines built WITHOUT an attached transport. Do not mix manual
output draining and automatic output ownership.

XS-backed transports can use Unblock::HTTP1::NativeABI v1 to pass borrowed
native input. The ABI is input-side and remains transport neutral. It
supports the same HTTP callbacks and can construct canonical Uniform
messages through Uniform::HTTP 0.06's native FastPath.

The installed C header is:

    Unblock/HTTP1/NativeABI/unblock_http1_native_abi.h

ABI discovery:

    Unblock::HTTP1::NativeABI::definition()
    Unblock::HTTP1::NativeABI::native_include_dir()
    Unblock::HTTP1::NativeABI::header_path()
    Unblock::HTTP1::NativeABI::c_header()

## Limits

Defaults:

    max_head_size              65536 bytes
    max_headers                100
    max_chunk_extension_size   16384 bytes
    high_water                 65536 bytes
    low_water                  32768 bytes
